# Pong
A simple Pong clone.

Use the A and Z keys to move the left paddle up and down.

Use the up arrow and down arrow to move the right paddle up and down.

Use the space bar to start the game and re-start after a point is scored.

There is no maximum number of points and the game continues until you exit the program.

This is my first Java project after completing the lessons from the MOOC Java Programming course from the University of Helsinki.
